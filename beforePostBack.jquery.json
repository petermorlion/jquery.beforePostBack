	"description" : "This jQuery plugin allows you to execute javascript before ASP.NET makes a postback and optionally stop it. Because ASP.NET (WebForms) doesn't raise a submit event, we need another way of subscribing to the postback. This plugin allows you to execute javascript functions before the form is posted to the server.",
